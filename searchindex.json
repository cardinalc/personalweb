[{"content":"Mathematical logic, theory of computation I am interested in the interaction of logic, games and autoamta.\nInfinite games The determinacy of Gale-Stewart games, i.e., one of the two players has a winning strategy, has been intensively studied. One of the celebrated results due to D.A. Martin (1975) states that \u0026ldquo;All the Gale-Stewart games with Borel winning sets are determined\u0026rdquo;.\nOn the other hand, the winning sets can also be defined by some kinds of automata. Büchi-Landweber (1969), and Walukiewicz (2001) constructed the winning strategies of infinite games in which winning sets are the $\\omega$-languages accepted by some deterministic finite/pushdown automata. Finkel (2013) further studied the infinite games in which the winning sets are $\\omega$-languages accepted by nondeterministic pushdown automata and proves such games are not determined even within the set theory $\\mathsf{ZFC}$.\nWe downscale Finkel\u0026rsquo;s results to lower level $\\omega$-languages. We investigate the determinacy strength of infinite games whose winning sets are recognized by nondeterministic pushdown automata with various acceptance conditions, e.g., safety, reachability and co-Büchi conditions. In terms of the foundational program \u0026ldquo;Reverse Mathematics\u0026rdquo;, the determinacy strength of such games is measured by the complexity of a winning strategy required by the determinacy. Noticing that infinite games recognized by nondeterministic pushdown automata have some resemblance to those by deterministic 2-stack visibly pushdown automata (2DVPA) with the same acceptance conditions, we first studied the determinacy of infinite games recognized by 2DVPA and the nondeterministic ones and then establish the relation with the infinite games recognized with nondeterministic pushdown automata with the same acceptance conditions.\nRecently, we extended the study to variants of probabilistic automata. Probabilistic automata is a natural extension of non-deterministic automata by replacing the non-determinism with a probability. In such a case, the accepting of an infinite word is evaluated not only by the usual acceptance conditions but also its probability, which is characterized by the so-called probability semantics.\nWenjuan Li, and Kazuyuki Tanaka, Determinacy of probabilistic ω-languages with strict threshold semantics, accepted by RIMS Kokyuroku(2024).

Modal $\\mu$-calculus Modal $\\mu$-calculus, an extension of modal logic by adding greatest and least fixpoint operators ($\\mu$/$\\nu$), is closely related with tree automata and parity games, which has wide applications in theoretical computer science due to its monotone iteration property. One fundamental issue is the complexity measure of formulas of modal $\\mu$-calculus, e.g., alternation depths and number of variables. That is, whether more alternation of $\\mu/ \\nu$ and variables are necessary to express some complex properties. The alternation hierarchy ($\\Sigma^{\\mu}_n$/$\\Pi^{\\mu}_n$, $n\\in \\mathbb{N}$) and variable hierarchy are proved to be strict respectively (Bradfield, 1998; Berwanger, Grädel, Lenzi, 2007), over the class of all transition systems.\nWe studied the one-variable fragment of modal $\\mu$-calculus and weak modal $\\mu$-calculus, which is essential the $\\Sigma^{\\mu}_2\\cap \\Pi^{\\mu}_2$ in the alternation hierarchy. Our proof of strictness relies on weak parity games. We are now working on more details of the transfinite extension of this result.\nLeonard Pacheco, Wenjuan Li, Kazuyuki Tanaka.

Query complexity of game trees The evaluation of game trees plays a crucial role in artificial intelligence, especially Boolean AND-OR trees, which provides a game-theoretic technique to design and analyze randomized algorithms (Saks and Wigderson, 1986; Yao, 1977).\nLiu and Tanaka (2007) characterized the eigen-distributions that achieve the distributional complexity, and proved the uniqueness of eigen-distribution for uniform binary trees. We generalized the results to balanced and even general multi-braching trees via the weighted game trees.\nKazuyuki Tanaka, NingNing Peng, Weiguang Peng, and Wenjuan Li.

Operational management Before pursuing logic, I studied operations management. My interests also lie in modeling real-life problems and making decision analysis, as well as developing data-driven methods to solve such problems.\nBi-objective energy-efficient scheduling in a seru production system considering reconfiguration of serus, Sustainable Computing: Informatics and Systems, 39, 100900, 2023. （with J.
