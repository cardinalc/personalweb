One of the celebrated results due to  D.A. Martin (1975) states that \u0026ldquo;All the Gale-Stewart games with Borel winning sets are determined\u0026rdquo;.  On the other hand, the winning sets can also be defined by some kinds of automata.\nBüchi and Landweber (1969), and  Walukiewicz (2001) constructed the winning strategies of infinite games in which winning sets are the $\\omega$-languages accepted by some deterministic finite/pushdown automata. Finkel (2013) further studied the infinite games in which the winning sets are $\\omega$-languages accepted by nondeterministic pushdown automata and proves such games are not determined even within the set theory $\\mathsf{ZFC}$.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe downscale Finkel\u0026rsquo;s results to lower level $\\omega$-languages. We investigate the determinacy strength of infinite games whose winning sets are recognized by nondeterministic pushdown automata with various acceptance conditions, \u003cem\u003ee.g.\u003c/em\u003e, safety, reachability and co-Büchi conditions. In terms of the foundational program \u0026ldquo;Reverse Mathematics\u0026rdquo;, the determinacy strength of such games is measured by the complexity of a winning strategy required by the determinacy. Noticing that infinite games recognized by nondeterministic pushdown automata have some resemblance to those by deterministic 2-stack visibly pushdown automata (2DVPA) with the same acceptance conditions, we start with investigating the determinacy of infinite games recognized by 2DVPA and the nondeterministic ones and then establish the relation with the infinite games recognized with nondeterministic pushdown automata with the same acceptance conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecently, I also extended the study along this line to variants of probabilistic automata. Probabilistic automata is a natural extension of non-deterministic automata by replacing the non-determinism with a probability. In such a case, the accepting of an infinite word is evaluated not only by the usual acceptance conditions but also its probability, which is characterized by the so-called probability semantics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWenjuan Li, and Kazuyuki Tanaka, Determinacy of probabilistic ω-languages with strict threshold semantics, accepted by RIMS Kokyuroku(2024).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWenjuan Li and Kazuyuki Tanaka, Second-order logic and related systems: a game-semantical perspective.

One fundamental issue is the \u003cem\u003ecomplexity measure\u003c/em\u003e of formulas of modal $\\mu$-calculus, \u003cem\u003ee.g.\u003c/em\u003e, alternation depths and number of variables. That is, whether more alternation of $\\mu/ \\nu$ and variables are necessary to express some complex properties. The alternation hierarchy ($\\Sigma^{\\mu}_n$/$\\Pi^{\\mu}_n$, $n\\in \\mathbb{N}$) and variable hierarchy are proved to be strict respectively (Bradfield, 1998; Berwanger, Grädel, Lenzi, 2007), over the class of all transition systems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe study the one-variable fragment of modal $\\mu$-calculus and weak modal $\\mu$-calculus, which is essential the same as $\\Sigma^{\\mu}_2\\cap \\Pi^{\\mu}_2$ in the alternation hierarchy.\nOur proof of strictness relies on weak parity games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am also intereted in the interaction of games and fixed point property, especially from the viewpoint of determinacy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLeonard Pacheco, Wenjuan Li, Kazuyuki Tanaka.
