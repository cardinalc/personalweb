My name is Wenjuan Li (李文娟). I am now a postdoc at Beijing Institute of Mathematical Sciences and Applications (BIMSA).  I obtained my PhD and master in mathematical logic from Mathematical Institute, Tohoku University, supervised by [Prof. Kazuyuki Tanaka (田中一之)](https://sendailogic.com/tanaka/). 

My research interests include mathematical logic, theory of computation, and decision analysis.
